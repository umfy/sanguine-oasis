## Life and Death
### Hit points
You have D4 + Endurance Dice Size HP. When damaged, subtract the damage dealt from your current HP.
### Magic points
You have D4 + Will Power Dice Size MP. When casting spells of level 1 and 2 subtract the cost from your current MP.

On character creation the rolled HP and MP can be swapped with each other to better fit character's theme.
### Dying
Every player character can aquire up to 3 wounds. Gaining more wounds kills the character.
When HP reaches 0, you start dying.
While dying add 1 wound point at the start of your turn.
When HP would become negative, you gain 1 wound point and set HP to 0.
When dying, player can act normally or roll Survival to stop dying.
Another player can aid dying character, which guarantees success on their next dying roll.

Consequences apply at the moment of getting a wound:
- 1 wound: minor consequence (twisted ankle, bleeding nose)
- 2 wound: major consequence (broken bone, deep cut)
- 3 wound: pernament consequence (limb cut off, pierced organ)

### Wounds
Wounds cause some actions to be more difficult by adding Disadvantage to the roll or even impossible to perform. 

### Rest and regeneration
The time in the game is divided into 6 hour watches. 
On a rest that takes one watch, restore HP and MP to full.
Also heal a minor condition. With enough medial attention, character can remove major consequence from wounds tracker and instead write down the effect of it in the character details. For example remove "broken arm" and add character desription "immobilized arm" instead. This frees up the wound slot for another condition.

[add character wound table and next to it recovery table or sth]
