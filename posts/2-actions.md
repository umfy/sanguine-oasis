## Action economy

Round - short amount of time in battle, about 10 seconds.

Turn - a section of a round in which one character acts.

Action - something a character can do in a round.

The Round is divided in two phases:

- short turns in which character can take only one Action.
  - players act
  - npcs act
- long turns in which a character can take two Actions.
  - players act
  - npcs act

Every character can choose one phase in which she wants to participate in. The
only restriction to the thing player can do in an action is limit of one attack
or spell cast per round.

Example actions:

- attack
- spell cast
- skill check
- move
- reload
- finish casting a spell


## Resolving success in battle

Each point of the Score can be used for a different effect from the table below.

- weapon damage (usually 2dmg)
- 1dmg
- 2 dmg DoT (3 rounds)
- AoE
- range up
- buff
- debuff
- debuff -> no save roll debuff
- aimed hit
- heal instead of dealing damage *
- focus -> 6 rounds *

*
  - applies to magic only

### Weapon actions

When fighting with weapons, you can declare how you use your Score after the
roll.

### Spell actions

When casting a spell you have to declare the effect and required Score before
the roll. Every spell has medium range by default. Each effect beyond first is
increasing the level of the spell:

- costs 1MP
- requires 1 additional success to cast
- grants D10 bonus to the roll
- gives ability to reroll bonus D10s on second Action this round

#### Examples:

lvl 0: Dealing 2 fire damage from range doesn't have a cost. lvl 1: Dealing 2
fire damage AoE costs 1 MP and adds D10 to the roll. If cast is unsuccesfull the
second Action can be used to reroll D10. lvl 2: Dealing 2 fire dagame AoE that
can blind opponents for 1 turn costs 2MP and adds 2D10 to the roll. If cast is
unsuccesfull the second Action can be used to reroll 2D10.
