## Dice Mechanics

When the situation is difficult the GM may demand a roll to test the character's
skill. In that case the adequate skill die is rolled besides the base roll which
is always D6.

The roll is successful when at least one die is 6 or more.

### Advantage

If the task should be easier because of your background or circumstances, add D6 Base Die to the roll

### Disadvantage

If task should be more difficult, remove D6 Base Die from the roll.

### Help

Helping player gives his Skill Die that can be used by another player instead of his Base Die.

### Critical Rolls
#### Critical Success

The critical success happens when both dice show success.

Critical rolls are rare. When resolving consequences of critical success, be encouraged to bend the baic rules of the game. With GM's help describe a cinematic moment, slay enemies with one point-blank shot, jump over the canyon with a somersault.

#### Critical Failure

The critical failure happens when dice show pairs of [1,1] [2,2] or [3,3].

Critical failures cause your equipment to malfunction or break, your leg to slip and your missiles to hit wrong targets.

#### The twist

Optionally the situation dramatically changes with a twist when dice show pairs of [4,4] or [5,5].
