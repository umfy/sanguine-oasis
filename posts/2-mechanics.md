## Dice Mechanics

When the situation is difficult the GM may demand a roll to test the character's
skill. In that case the adequate skill die is rolled besides the base roll which
is always D6.

If the task should be easier because of your background or circumstances, you may reroll one of the dice.
If the task should be more difficult, add D4 to the roll.

[table % chance of at least 1 success]

### Scoring

Add success when value is 5+. Add two successes when the value is 10+. 
The roll is a failure if at least one die shows 1.

### Critical Rolls
#### Critical Success
The critical success happens when two successful dice show the same number or there are three or more successes in a roll.

Critical rolls are rare. When resolving consequences of critical success, be encouraged to bend the baic rules of the game. With GM's help describe a cinematic moment, slay enemies with one point-blank shot, jump over the canyon with a somersault.

#### Critical Failure
The critical failure happens when two or more dice show 1.

Critical failures cause your equipment to malfunction or break, your leg to slip and your missiles to hit wrong targets.
