## Character description

When creating a character write down their most important features, as listed below. 
Those features are not only narrative flavour but they also give advantages during play.
The player may reroll once if the character's background would help them accomplish a certain task. 
You don't have to fill all the aspects at once, they can be discovered later during play.

- name and ancestry
- origin
- general looks
- clothing preferences
- vocation
- hobby or ex-vocation
- affiliation to the group
- good memory from simpler times

- important person

The memories is what makes a character real, this is what replaces intelligence stat in this game. 
If your character was a merchant in a foreign country it means they will know the foreign language and manners. 
If they are a priest, they know a thing or two about deities and gods.
If they were a fisherman they know how to tie knots and sail pretty well.
