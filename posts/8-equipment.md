## Offense
### Weapons

Weapons differ from each other by narrative aspects like their reach, weight or ability to conceal it.

Many weapons have feats assigned to them.

- reach
- heavy
- light
- balanced
- serrated
- small
- large

## Magical instruments

Staffs, talismans, and music instruments can have certain spells assigned to them.
This allows a caster to cast these spells without knowing the specific elemental domain.

## Defense
### Armor

The armor provides the damage mitigation.

0 - naked 
1 - clothing 
2 - leather 
3 - chainmail 
4 - full plate

1 - any protective helmet or custom defensive piece

Heavy armor imposes disadvantage to some checks like agility or stealth.

Some heavy armors allow player to get one more wound before dying - the armor
gets destroyed instead of player taking a pernament consequence.

### Shields
Shields allow to win fighting contests when both sides have the same ammount of success, but they also break in the process.
