## Offense
### Weapons

Weapons deal bonus damage on successful attack.
Other narrative aspects of weapons are their reach, weight or ability to conceal it.

## Magical instruments

Staffs, talismans, and music instruments can have certain spells assigned to them.
This allows a caster to cast these spells without knowing the specific elemental domain.

## Defense
### Armor

The armor gives bonus to defense roll.

Heavy armor imposes disadvantage to some checks like agility or stealth.

Some heavy armors allow player to get one more wound before dying - the armor
gets destroyed instead of player taking a pernament consequence.

### Shields
Shields allow to reroll die roll of 1 but if the rerolled value is 1 again, the shield breaks.
