## Offense
### Weapons

Weak attacks deal 0dmg. (unarmed, throwing rocks).
Most weapons deal 1dmg. (knives, axes, bows).
Advanced weapons deal 2dmg (Two handed swords, crossbows).

Weapons differ from each other by narrative aspects like their reach, weight or ability to conceal it.
Many weapons have feats assigned to them:
- reach
- heavy
- light
- balanced
- serrated
- small
- large

## Magical instruments

Staffs, talismans, and music instruments can have certain spells assigned to them.
This allows a caster to cast these spells without knowing the specific elemental domain.

## Defense
### Armor

The light armor can provide additional HP.
Heavy armor can give additional HP and raise minimum value of EP. That causes heavily armoured characters more resistant to taking serious wounds (the HP is less likely to drop below 1).

Armor can impose a disadvantage to some checks like agility or stealth.

#### Example
Mage's robe: +1HP

Plate mail: +2HP +2 min EP

### Shields

Shields allow to win fighting contests when both sides have the same ammount of success, but they also break in the process.
