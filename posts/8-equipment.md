## Offense
### Weapons

Weak attacks deal 0dmg. (unarmed, throwing rocks).
Most weapons deal 1dmg. (knives, axes, bows).
Advanced weapons deal 2dmg (Two handed swords, crossbows, firearms).

Weapons differ from each other by narrative aspects like their reach, weight or ability to conceal it.
Many weapons have feats assigned to them:
- reach
- heavy
- light
- balanced
- serrated
- small
- large


### Breaking weapons

The player can decide to break their weapon on attack which allows them to win fighting contests when both sides have the same ammount of success.

## Magical instruments

Staffs, talismans, and music instruments can have certain spells assigned to them.
This allows a caster to cast these spells without knowing the specific elemental domain.

## Defense
### Armor

The light armor can provide additional HP.
Heavy armor can give additional HP and raise minimum value of EP. That causes heavily armoured characters more resistant to taking serious wounds (the HP is less likely to drop below 1 causing serious wounds).

Armor can impose a disadvantage to some checks like agility or stealth.

#### Example

Default clothing: +1HP +1 min EP
Mage's robe: +1HP
Leather armor: +2HP +2 min EP
Plate armor: +3HP +3 min EP

### Shields

Instead of taking a wound, a wielded shield can be destroyed.
