## Stats
### Hit points

You have D6 HP. When damaged, subtract the damage dealt from your current HP.

### Exhaustion points

The spells and attacks can be empowered by gaining Exhaustion Points.
Additionally Exhaustion Points can be gained when character is burdened or sick.

#### Tracking HP and EP in game

Keep two trackers on the table.
The HP tracker is initially set on your max HP and goes down when you are damaged.
The EP tracker is initially set to 1 and goes up when you use HP to cast spells etc.
You start dying when HP tracker is lower than EP tracker.

## Dying

Each player character can aquire up to 3 wounds. Gaining more wounds kills the character.
When HP value changes to be lower than EP, you gain 1 wound and start Dying. 
While Dying add 1 wound point at the end of your turn.
When HP would become less than 1, you gain 1 wound point in order to set HP back to 1.

When Dying, player can act normally or roll Survival to stop Dying. Another player can aid Dying character, which gives Help on their next Survival roll.

Circumstances that restore HP above EP (or would be able to restore more HP than maximum value), also stop character from Dying.

Consequences apply at the moment of getting a wound:

- 1 wound: minor consequence (twisted ankle, bleeding nose)
- 2 wound: major consequence (broken bone, deep cut)
- 3 wound: pernament consequence (limb cut off, pierced organ)

## Wounds

Wounds cause some actions to be more difficult by adding Disadvantage to the
roll or even impossible to perform.

### Rest and regeneration

The time in the game is divided into 6 hour watches. On a rest that takes one
watch you can choose one of the following:
- restore all EP
- restore HP by number of successes on Survival roll
- heal a minor condition on successful Survival roll

With enough medial attention, character can remove major consequence from wounds tracker and
instead write down the effect of it in the character details. For example remove
"broken arm" and add character desription "immobilized arm" instead. This frees
up the wound slot for another condition.

| wound     | consequence                    | partial healing time | full recovery tume |
|-----------|--------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| minor     | bumps, knocks and bruises      | -                    | one watch rest     |
| major     | strong bleedings, broken bones | one watch rest       | weeks              |
| permanent | limb cut off, pierced organ    | weeks                | -                  |
