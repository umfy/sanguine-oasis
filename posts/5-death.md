## Stats
### Hit points

You have 3D6 HP. When damaged, subtract the damage dealt from your current HP.

### Using hit points to cast magic

The spells can be empowered by using HP.
HP lost this way can only be restored though natural healing processes.
The amount of HP used this way is called Exhaustion Points (EP).

#### Tracking HP in game
To keep track of the damage used on spells keep 2 HP trackers on the table.
The HP tracker is initially set on your max HP and goes down when you are damaged.
The EP tracker is initially set to 1 and goes up when you use HP to cast spells.
You start dying when HP tracker is lower than EP tracker.

## Dying

Each player character can aquire up to 3 wounds. Gaining more wounds kills the character.
When HP becomes lower than EP, you gain 1 wound and start Dying. 
While Dying add 1 wound point at the end of your turn.
When absolute HP would become less than 1, you gain 1 wound point and set HP to 1 instead.

When Dying, player can act normally or roll Survival to stop Dying. Another player can aid Dying character, which guarantees success on their next Dying roll.

Circumstances that restore HP above EP, also stop character from Dying.

Consequences apply at the moment of getting a wound:

- 1 wound: minor consequence (twisted ankle, bleeding nose)
- 2 wound: major consequence (broken bone, deep cut)
- 3 wound: pernament consequence (limb cut off, pierced organ)

## Wounds

Wounds cause some actions to be more difficult by adding Disadvantage to the
roll or even impossible to perform.

### Rest and regeneration

The time in the game is divided into 6 hour watches. On a rest that takes one
watch, restore HP by total value of dice on your survival roll. Also heal a minor condition. 
With enough medial attention, character can remove major consequence from wounds tracker and
instead write down the effect of it in the character details. For example remove
"broken arm" and add character desription "immobilized arm" instead. This frees
up the wound slot for another condition.
