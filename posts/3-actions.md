## Action economy

**Round** - short amount of time in battle, about 10 seconds.
When the wording "for one round" is used, it means from now to the end of your next turn.

**Turn** - a section of a round in which one character acts.

**Action** - something a character can do in a round.

The Round is divided in two phases:

- short turns in which character can take only one Action.
  - players act
  - npcs act
- long turns in which a character can take two Actions.
  - players act
  - npcs act

Every character can choose one phase in which she wants to participate in. The
only restriction to the thing player can do in an action is limit of one attack
or one spell cast per round.

Example actions:

- attack
- spell cast
- skill check
- move
- swap weapon
- use an item
- reload

## Rolling aganist active opposition

When both sides of the conflict can use their skills to change the outcome of the situation, the larger level of success wins. On a draw, compare numbers on the higher dice. If it's still a draw, something unexpected happens that changes the situation completely.

For Area of Effect opposition, only the most skilled target rolls for all opposing participants.

#### Examples:
Player hiding from the guards roll for Stealth ([D6,D8] -> [1,6]), one of the guards roll for Perception ([D6,D10] -> [3,8]). Both sides get a success but the guard wins the conflict (because 8 > 6).

### Fighting success

Each success allows you to take one unique effect from the list below.
You can empower your attack by spending 1 HP before the roll to gain additional effect. This represents the physical exaustion caused by performing complicated manouver.

- 1 damage + weapon damage
- 1 damage
- DoT ([D6], [D6] over 2 turns)
- AoE
- charge / range up
- manouver
- push 3m -> 6m
- aimed hit

#### Basic attack

It's the most default way of dealing damage. It's weapon damage plus 1 for each success rolled.

#### Melee combat

If attacker wins they choose how to spend the fighting success. If defender wins they dodge and hit Basic Attack. If the defender doesn't currently hold melee weapon they can only cause unarmed damage.

#### Ranged combat

If attacker wins they choose how to spend the fighting success. If defender wins they dodge or block.
When Ranged attacks are performed aganist opponents in melee range, the defender that wins dodges and hits Basic Attack like in melee combat.

### Casting spells

If a target is affected by the spell aganist their will, they can oppose it with a skill roll to dodge it or if at melee range dodge it and hit Basic Attack.
If there is no active opposition, the spell just works without rolling the dice.

When casting spells you end your turn unarmed.

Using magic requires you to spend HP equal to the spell's power.

| HP cost | Added spell effects |
|---------|---------------------|
| 0       | 0                   |
| 1       | 1                   |
| 2       | 2                   |
| 3       | 3                   |

Your life is locked in the spell until it ends.

Every spell has medium range by default. When casting a spell, you decide what unique additional effects shoud the spell have:

- 1 damage + weapon damage (1)
- 1 damage
- DoT ([D6], [D6] over 2 turns)
- AoE
- range up
- debuff
- push 3m -> 6m
- aimed hit
- buff
- focus -> 6 rounds 

#### Examples:
Custom spells made from scratch:
Power 1: Dealing ([D6,D12]-> [3,10]) 1 + 1 = 2 fire damage from range costs 0HP and requires a successful roll. 
Power 2: Dealing ([D6,D12]-> [3,10]) 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 fire damage from range costs 1HP and requires a successful roll.
Power 2: Dealing ([D6,D12]-> [6,8])  1 + 1 = 2 fire damage AoE costs 1HP and requires successful roll.
Power 3: Dealing ([D6,D12]-> [6,11]) 1 + 1 = 2 fire dagame AoE that can blind opponents for 1 turn costs 2HP and requires successful roll. 

### Dodging

Skills like Agility can be used defensively if that makes sense, usually in environmental hazards and role play, mitigating damage entirely.
