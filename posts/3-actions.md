## Action economy

Round - short amount of time in battle, about 10 seconds.
When the wording "for one round" is used, it means from now to the end of your next turn.

Turn - a section of a round in which one character acts.

Action - something a character can do in a round.

The Round is divided in two phases:

- short turns in which character can take only one Action.
  - players act
  - npcs act
- long turns in which a character can take two Actions.
  - players act
  - npcs act

Every character can choose one phase in which she wants to participate in. The
only restriction to the thing player can do in an action is limit of one attack
or one spell cast per round.

Example actions:

- attack
- spell cast
- skill check
- move
- reload


## Resolving success in battle
To perform an action pick an effect from the possible effects and roll the dice. 
You need at least one success from the dice roll to perform the task. 

The additional effects can be invoked by using the HP.

In single roll all effects must be unique unless written with an extension ( -> ). 
It means spending more points on that particular effect will increase it's power.

### Fighting success
You can use up to 1 HP in one test. This represents the physical exaustion gained by performing complicated manouver.
Additional succeses allow you to take more effects after the roll is made.

- highest die damage
- lowest die damage -> 2 * lowest die damage
- [D6, D6] DoT (over 2 turns)
- AoE
- charge / range up
- manouver -> no save roll manouver
- push 3m -> 6m
- aimed hit

### Magic success
You can use up to 2 HP in one test. This represents life energy drained by the power of the spell.
After the cost of a spell is established, the additional successes don't allow for more effects.

- highest die damage
- lowest die damage -> 2 * lowest die damage
- [D6, D6] DoT (over 2 turns)
- AoE
- range up
- debuff -> no save roll debuff
- push 3m -> 6m
- aimed hit
- buff
- heal instead of dealing damage (can't use highest damage die)
- focus -> 6 rounds 

### Weapon actions

When fighting with weapons, you can declare how you use your additional successes after the
roll. Add the weapon damage to the successful attack roll.

### Spell actions

When casting a spell you have to declare the full effect before the roll. 
Each effect beyond first requires you to spend 1 MP. 
That increases level of the spell by 1, up to the maximum of 2.

Every spell has medium range by default.
Add the weapon damage to the successful attack roll.

#### Examples:

lvl 0: Dealing ([D6, D12] +1 -> [3, 10]) 11 fire damage from range doesn't have a cost but requires successful roll. 
lvl 1: Dealing ([D6, D12] +1 -> [6, 8]) 15 fire damage costs 1 MP and requires successful roll.
lvl 1: Dealing ([D6, D12] +1 -> [6, 8]) 9 fire damage AoE costs 1 MP and requires successful roll.
lvl 2: Dealing ([D6, D12] +1 -> [6, 11]) 12 fire dagame AoE that can blind opponents for 1 turn costs 2MP and requires successful roll.

### Defensive action
When target is about to get hit, he may roll for defense.
The damage is reduced by the value of lower die + armor defense value, no matter if roll is successful or not.
On two successes or more the target doesn't take any damage. The hit is parried or is dodged completely.
