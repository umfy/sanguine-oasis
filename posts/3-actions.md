## Action economy

**Round** - short amount of time in battle, about 10 seconds.
When the wording "for one round" is used, it means from now to the end of your next turn.

**Turn** - a section of a round in which one character acts.

**Action** - something a character can do in a round.

The Round is divided in two phases:

- short turns in which character can take only one Action.
  - players act
  - npcs act
- long turns in which a character can take two Actions.
  - players act
  - npcs act

Every character can choose one phase in which she wants to participate in. The
only restriction to the thing player can do in an action is limit of one attack
or one spell cast per round.

Example actions:

- attack
- spell cast
- skill check
- move
- reload


## Resolving success in battle
To perform an action pick an effect from the possible effects and roll the dice. 
You need at least one success from the dice roll to perform the task. 
At least one effect must be described before the roll, the details can be settled later.

In a single roll all effects must be unique unless written with an extension ( -> ). 
It means spending more points on that particular effect will increase it's power.

### Fighting success
You empower your attack by spending 1 HP before the roll. 
This represents the physical exaustion caused by performing complicated manouver.
Additional succeses allow you to take more effects after the roll is made.

- highest die damage
- lowest die damage
- [D6, D6] DoT (over 2 turns)
- AoE
- charge / range up
- manouver -> no save roll manouver
- push 3m -> 6m
- aimed hit

### Magic success
Each effect beyond first requires you to spend 1 HP. 
That increases level of the spell by 1, up to the maximum of 2.
This represents life energy drained by the power of the spell.
After the cost of a spell is established, the additional successes allow for more effects.

Every spell has medium range by default.

- highest die damage
- lowest die damage
- [D6, D6] DoT (over 2 turns)
- AoE
- range up
- debuff -> no save roll debuff
- push 3m -> 6m
- aimed hit
- buff
- heal instead of dealing damage
- focus -> 6 rounds 

#### Examples:

lvl 0: Dealing ([D6, D12] +1 -> [3, 10]) 11 fire damage from range doesn't have a cost but requires successful roll. 
lvl 1: Dealing ([D6, D12] +1 -> [6, 8]) 15 fire damage costs 1 MP and requires successful roll.
lvl 1: Dealing ([D6, D12] +1 -> [6, 8]) 9 fire damage AoE costs 1 MP and requires successful roll.
lvl 2: Dealing ([D6, D12] +1 -> [6, 11]) 12 fire dagame AoE that can blind opponents for 1 turn costs 2MP and requires successful roll. 

### Defensive action
When target is about to get hit, he may roll for defense.
The damage is reduced by the value of lower die + armor defense value, no matter if roll is successful or not.
On two successes or more the target doesn't take any damage. The hit is parried or is dodged completely.

### Dodging
Other skills like Agility can be used defensively if that makes sense. They work like classic Defensive action but don't add armor defense value to the roll. 

If the hit would deal damage, two successes are required to dodge it.
If the hit doesn't deal damage (more common in environmental hazards and role play), only one success is required to dodge.
