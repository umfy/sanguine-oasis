## Action economy

**Round** - short amount of time in battle, about 10 seconds.
When the wording "for one round" is used, it means from now to the end of your next turn.

**Turn** - a section of a round in which one character acts.

**Action** - something a character can do in a round.

The Round is divided in two phases:

- short turns in which character can take only one Action.
  - players act
  - npcs act
- long turns in which a character can take two Actions.
  - players act
  - npcs act

Every character can choose one phase in which she wants to participate in. The
only restriction to the thing player can do in an action is limit of one attack
or one spell cast per round.

Example actions:

- attack
- spell cast
- skill check
- move
- use an item
- reload

## Rolling aganist active opposition
When both sides of the conflict can use their skills to change the outcome of the situation, the larger level of success wins. On a draw, compare numbers on the higher dice. If it's still a draw, something unexpected happens that changes the situation completely.

#### Examples:
Player hiding from the guards roll for Stealth ([D6,D8] -> [1,6]), one of the guards roll for Perception ([D6,D10] -> [3,8]). Both sides get a success but the guard wins the conflict (because 8 > 6).
### Fighting success
You can empower your attack by spending 2 HP before the roll. 
This represents the physical exaustion caused by performing complicated manouver.
Additional success from critical hit allow you to take one more effect after the roll is made.

- higher die damage
- lower die damage
- DoT ([D6], [D6] over 2 turns)
- AoE
- charge / range up
- manouver
- push 3m -> 6m
- aimed hit

#### Melee combat
Winner deals higher die damage to the opponent. If the defender doesn't currently hold melee weapon they can only cause unarmed damage. The defender may choose to dodge the attack instead.

#### Ranged combat
If attacker wins they deal higher die damage to the opponent. If defender wins they dodge or block.

### Casting spells
If a target is affected by the spell directly, they can oppose it with a skill roll to dodge it.

Using magic requires you to spend HP equal to the spell's power.

| HP cost | Added spell effects |
|---------|---------------------|
| 1       | 0                   |
| 2       | 1                   |
| 4       | 2                   |
| 6       | 3                   |
| 2n      | n                   |

Your life is locked in the spell until it ends.

Every spell has medium range by default. When casting a spell, you decide what unique additional effects shoud the spell have:

- higher die damage
- lower die damage
- DoT ([D6], [D6] over 2 turns)
- AoE
- range up
- debuff
- push 3m -> 6m
- aimed hit
- buff
- focus -> 6 rounds 

#### Examples:
Custom spells made from scratch:
Power 1: Dealing ([D6,D12]-> [3,10]) 10 fire damage from range costs 1HP and requires a successful roll. 
Power 2: Dealing ([D6,D12]-> [3,10]) 13 fire damage from range costs 2HP and requires a successful roll. 
Power 2: Dealing ([D6,D12]-> [6,8]) 8 fire damage AoE costs 2HP and requires successful roll.
Power 3: Dealing ([D6,D12]-> [6,11]) 11 fire dagame AoE that can blind opponents for 1 turn costs 3HP and requires successful roll. 

### Damage reduction
The damage taken is reduced by target's armour value.

#### Example:
Sword attack of ([D6,D10] -> [2,8] -> 8 dmg) is reduced by Armour 2 dealing 6 dmg.

### Dodging
Skills like Agility can be used defensively if that makes sense, usually in environmental hazards and role play, mitigating damage entirely.
