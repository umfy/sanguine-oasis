## Action economy

Round - short amount of time in battle, about 10 seconds.
When the wording "for one round" is used, it means from now to the end of your next turn.

Turn - a section of a round in which one character acts.

Action - something a character can do in a round.

The Round is divided in two phases:

- short turns in which character can take only one Action.
  - players act
  - npcs act
- long turns in which a character can take two Actions.
  - players act
  - npcs act

Every character can choose one phase in which she wants to participate in. The
only restriction to the thing player can do in an action is limit of one attack
or one spell cast per round.

Example actions:

- attack
- spell cast
- skill check
- move
- reload


## Resolving success in battle

Each point of the Score can be used for a different effect from the table below. In one roll, effects must be unique, unless written with an extension ( -> ). It means spending more points on that particular effect increase it's power.

- highest die damage
- lowest die damage -> x2
- [D6, D6] DoT (over 2 turns)
- AoE
- range up
- buff
- debuff
- push 3m -> 6m
- debuff -> no save roll debuff
- aimed hit
- heal instead of dealing damage *
- focus -> 6 rounds *

### Weapon actions

When fighting with weapons, you can declare how you use your additional successes after the
roll. Add the weapon damage to the successful attack roll.

### Spell actions

When casting a spell you have to declare the full effect before the roll. 
Each effect beyond first requires you to spend 1 MP. 
That increases level of the spell by 1, up to the maximum of 2.

Every spell has medium range by default.
Add the weapon damage to the successful attack roll.

#### Examples:

lvl 0: Dealing ([D6, D12] +1 -> [3, 10]) 11 fire damage from range doesn't have a cost but requires successful roll. 
lvl 1: Dealing ([D6, D12] +1 -> [6, 8]) 15 fire damage costs 1 MP and requires successful roll.
lvl 1: Dealing ([D6, D12] +1 -> [6, 8]) 9 fire damage AoE costs 1 MP and requires successful roll.
lvl 2: Dealing ([D6, D12] +1 -> [6, 11]) 12 fire dagame AoE that can blind opponents for 1 turn costs 2MP and requires successful roll.

### Defensive action
When target is about to get hit, he may roll for defense.
The damage is reduced by the value of lower die + armor defense value, no matter if roll is successful or not.
On two successes or more the target doesn't take any damage. The hit is parried or is dodged completely.
