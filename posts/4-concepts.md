### Aimed hit

You hit a specific desired point, a bullseye. It often causes a debuff or bonus damage to the target.

### Damage over time

Deal 1 damage each turn for 2 turns.

#### Example
Imagine casting toxic dart (1HP cost) ([D6,D10] -> [1,10]) that deals 1 + 1 = 2 damage instantly and 2 damage DoT later.
The target rolls ([D6,D8] -> [4,7]), lower level of success (7 < 10) so spell hits. The spell will deal:
- 2 damage instantly
- 1 damage on the start of caster's next turn
- 1 damage on the start of caster's turn after that.

### Buff

Usually a magical influence that aids the caster like giving Advantage to the next attack or defense roll or giving temporary resistance to poison.

### Debuff

It's a manouver like holding, disarming, tripping or blinding your opponent. 
Magicall debuffs may be more creative like obscuring vision or creating slippery surface. By default it imposes the Disadvantage to the target's rolls for 1 round.

The specific effects may vary based on the description, for example disarming means the target has to spend one Action to pick the weapon up (if it's still there).

### Focus

When focusing on a spell you keep active as long as you don't cast another
spell or get specifically debuffed.

### Falling

For every 2 meters falling, add 1 dmg on impact. 
Alternatively for every 2 meters of the fall you may roll:
- [D8, D8] or
- [D6, D10] 

When falling controllably, player may roll Agiliy to half the damage for each success (rounded down).

#### Example
Player falls on their feet from 12m which can deal up to 6dmg. 
The player rolls Agility which reduces the damage by ([D6, D12] -> [6, 9]) 50% twice. 
The fall causes 6 / 2 = 3 and halved second time 3 / 2 = 1.5 -> 1 damage.

### Hitting a wall

When hitting a wall with great force, subtract initial distance to a wall from the maximum distance you would travel without hitting an obstacle. For resulting value the rules as for falling apply, however the damage cannot be reduced with Agility roll.

#### Example
Standing 1 meter from a wall and being pushed into it 3 meters is
equal to falling from 2 meters. 

Standing 3 meters from a wall and being pushed into it 9 meters is equal to falling from 6 meters.
