### Aimed hit

You hit a specific desired point, a bullseye. It often causes a debuff or bonus damage to the target.

### Damage over time

Deal the total amount of damage split among 2 target's turns. 
The player can be handed DoT dice to roll at the start of their turn.
The 2 instances of damage are not reduced by target's defense.

#### Example
Imagine casting power 2 toxic dart (3HP cost) ([D6,D10] -> [1,10]) that deals 10 + [D6,D6] DoT. 
The target rolls ([D6,D8] -> [4,7]), lower level of success (7 < 10) so spell hits. Target's defense is 3 so  the spell will deal:
- (10 - 3) 7 damage instantly
- D6 damage on the start of caster's next turn
- D6 damage on the start of caster's turn after that.

### Buff

Usually a magical influence that aids the caster like giving Advantage to the next attack or defense roll or giving temporary resistance to poison.

### Debuff

It's a manouver like holding, disarming, tripping or blinding your opponent. 
Magicall debuffs may be more creative like obscuring vision or creating slippery surface. By default it adds a D6 Disadvantage to the target's rolls for 1 round.

The specific effects may vary based on the description, for example disarming means the target has to spend one Action to pick the weapon up (if it's still there).

### Focus

When focusing on a spell you keep active as long as you don't cast another
spell or get specifically debuffed.

### Falling
For every 2 meters falling, add 1 dmg on impact. 
Alternatively for every 2 meters of the fall you may roll:
- [D8, D8] or
- [D6, D10] 

When falling controllably, player may roll Agiliy to reduce damage by lower die value.
The double success has no effect there. Noone can escape gravity.

#### Example
Player falls on their feet from 15m which can deal up to 7dmg. 
The player rolls Agility which reduces the damage by ([D6, D12] -> [5, 9]) 5. 
The fall causes 2 damage.

### Hitting a wall

When hitting a wall with great force, subtract initial distance to a wall from the maximum distance you would travel without hitting an obstacle. For resulting value the rules as for falling apply, however the damage cannot be reduced with Agility roll.

#### Example
Standing 1 meter from a wall and being pushed into it 3 meters is
equal to falling from 2 meters. 

Standing 3 meters from a wall and being pushed into it 9 meters is equal to falling from 6 meters.
