## Offense
### Aimed hit

You hit a specific desired point, a bullseye. It often causes a debuff for the
target.

### Damage over time

Deal the total amount of damage split among 2 target's turns. 
The player can be handed DoT dice to roll at the start of their turn.
The 2 instances of damage are not reduced by target's defense.
If this attack is fully negated (2 successes on defense), the attack will not deal any damage.

#### Example
Imagine casting lvl 1 toxic dart (D6,D10 -> 3,10) that deals 10 dmg and 2*D6 dmg DoT. 
The target rolls (D6, D8 -> 4, 7) 4 damage reduction on defense. The spell will deal:
- (10 - 4) 6 damage instantly
- D6 damage on the start of enemy's next turn
- D6 damage on the start of enemy's turn after that.

The total damage is split as evenly as possible, prioritizing early turns.

### Buff

Usually a magical influence that aids the caster like giving Reroll to next hit
roll or giving temporary resistance to poison. When used as a result of weapon
fighting roll, it can be a commanding battlecry that gives Reroll to next attack
roll or gaining the defence stance in battle (Reroll on defense for 1 round).

### Debuff

It's a manouver like holding, disarming, tripping or blinding your opponent.
Magicall debuffs may be more creative like obscuring vision or creating slippery
surface. By default it adds a D4 penalty to the target's rolls for 1 round unless
the target makes successful Endurance roll.

The effects may vary based on the description, for example disarming means the
target has to spend one Action to pick the weapon up (if it's still there).

## Defense
### Focus

When focusing on a spell you keep active as long as you don't cast another
spell or get specifically debuffed.

### Defend

Use Hand to Hand Combat skill to reduce incoming damage by the success amount.
This is a combination of armor defense, dodging, parrying and blocking abilities.

If in single turn the target recieves damage from more than 1 source, only one
defense roll can be made. If the defense roll is high enough to fully absorb the
first hit, the remaining value is used to defend aganist next hits.

#### Example
A player attacks the target with a bow for ([D6, D12] +1 -> [2, 5] +1) 6 damage on her first
Action. The target rolls ([D6, D8] +5 -> [3, 6] +5) 8 on defense. 8 - 6 = 2 so hit is absorbed and 2
defense remains unused. On her second Action the player commands an illusionary
dog to bite the target dealing ([D6, D6] -> 4, 6) 6 damage. The target recieves 6 - 2 = 4 damage.

## Breaking the neck
### Falling

For every 2 meters falling, add 1 dmg on impact. 
Alternatively for every 2 meters of the fall you may roll:
- [D8, D8] or
- [D6, D10] 
ignoring all values of 1.

When falling controllably, player may roll Agiliy to reduce damage by lower damage value.
The double success has no effect there. Noone can escape gravity.

#### Example
Player falls on their feet from 15m which can deal up to 7dmg. 
The player rolls Agility which reduces the damage by ([D6, D12] -> [5, 9]) 5. 
The fall causes 2 damage.

### Hitting a wall

When hitting a wall with great force, subtract initial distance to a wall from
the maximum distance you would travel without hitting an obstacle. For resulting
value the rules as for falling apply, however the damage cannot be reduced with
Agility roll.

#### Example
Standing 1 meter from a wall and being pushed into it 3 meters is
equal to falling from 2 meters. 

Standing 3 meters from a wall and being pushed into it 9 meters is equal to falling from 6 meters.
