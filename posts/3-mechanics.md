## Dice Mechanics

When the situation is difficult the GM may demand a roll to test the character's
skill. In that case the adequate skill die is rolled besides the base roll which
is always D8.

If the task should be easier because of your background or circumstances, add
D10 die to the roll. If the task should be more difficult, add 2D4 to the roll.
These bonuses and penalties can be adjusted. For simplicity the bonuses and
penalties can balance each other.

[table % chance of at least 1 success]

Add success when value is 6+. Add two successes when the value is 10+. Subtract
success when the value is 1.

Result of resolving a roll by counting number of successes is called Score.

### Dice size

The dice used in the game are as follows: 
|symbol|dice size| 
|------|------|
|D4|-1| 
|D6|0| 
|D8|1| 
|D10|2|
|D12|3|

The dice size are additive so D8 + D8 is roughly equal to D10. Dice size can
also be higher so for example Dice Size 7 is D12 + D12 + D8.
