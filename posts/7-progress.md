## The rewards
After each session every player is granted 2D10 Experience Points. The GM can
give more points depending on the session, for example bonus D6 for being heroic
in role play or bonus 1 for helping with cleaning the table after the game.

The experinence points can be spent to increase Skill's Dice Size: 
- D6 -> D8 - 8
- points D8 -> D10 - 10 
- points D10 -> D12 - 12 points

The experience points can be spent to increase HP by 1 point. The cost is equal to the new HP value:
- 8HP -> 9HP - 9
- 12HP -> 13HP - 13
