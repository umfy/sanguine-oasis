## The rewards

### Improving skill

After each session every player is granted 2D10 Experience Points. The GM can
give more points depending on the session, for example bonus D6 for being heroic
in role play or bonus 1 for helping with cleaning the table after the game.

The experinence points can be spent to increase Skill's Dice Size: 
- D6 -> D8 - 8 points
- points D8 -> D10 - 16 points
- points D10 -> D12 - 24 points

### Improving Hit Points

6 experience points can be spent in order to try to increase HP. The player rolls D6 - if the result is higher than current HP, the HP increases by 1.

### Gaining character traits

During the adventures the character will gain new experiences, meet new important people, change their looks, gain scars or join new groups. Note the important details on your character sheet to reference them in play.
