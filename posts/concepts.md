## Concepts
### Focus
When focusing on a spell you keep active as long as you don't cast another spell, dodge or get specifically debuffed.

### Aimed hit
You hit a specific desired point, a bullseye. It often causes a debuff for the target.

### Damage over time
Deal the total amount of damage split among 3 turns.

For example imagine casting lvl 1 toxic dart that deals 2 dmg + 2 dmg DoT. The target rolls 1 success for defense. The spell will deal 3 damage split among 3 rounds so 1 damage instantly and 1 damage on the start of enemy's next turn and 1 damage turn after that. 

The total damage is split as evenly as possible, prioritizing early turns.
[table below]
dmg | turns
1 - 1 0 0
2 - 1 1 0
3 - 1 1 1
4 - 2 1 1 
5 - 2 2 1
6 - 2 2 2 
etc.

### Buff
Usually a magical influence that aids the caster like giving Bonus to next hit roll or giving temporary resistance to poison. When used as a result of weapon fighting roll, it can be a commanding battlecry that gives Bonus to next attack roll or gaining the defence stance in battle (D10 bonus to defense for 1 round).

### Debuff
Is a manouver like holding,	disarming, tripping or blinding your opponent. Magicall debuffs may be more creative like obscuring vision or creating slippery surface. By default it adds 2D4 penalty to the target's rolls for 1 round unless the target makes successful Endurance roll. 

The effects may vary based on the description, for example disarming means the target has to spend one Action to pick the weapon up (if it's still there). 

[EFFECTS APPLY INSTANTLY AND TICK DOWN AT THE END OF NEXT ROUND.]

### Defend
Use Hand to Hand Combat skill to reduce incoming damage by the success amount. This is a combination of armor defense,parrying and blocking abilities. 

If in single turn the target recieves damage from more than 1 source, only one defense roll can be made. If the defense roll is high enough to fully absorb the first hit, the remaining score is used to defend aganist next hits.

For example, a player attacks the target with a bow for 2 damage on her first Action. The target rolls 3 on defense. 3 - 2 = 1 so hit is absorbed and 1 defense remains unused. On her second Action the player commands an illusionary dog to bite the target dealing 2 damage. The target recieves 2 - 1 = 1 damage.

Shields allow to reroll -1, then the shield breaks.

### Dodge
You can use Agility roll to dodge all damage or effect if you get at least 1 success. After that you cannot defend yourself nor dodge untill your next round.

### Block
Blocking with a weapon or a shield allows to reroll 1 on defense roll which causes the used tool to break.


### Falling
For every 4 meters add 1 dmg to the fall, it's called Initial Damage. If more precise measurement is required, for every meter of the fall add 1 Dice Size to the damage roll. Negative dice score doesn't reduce the Initial Damage.

When falling controllably, player may roll Agiliy to reduce damage by 1 for each success.

Falling from 6m results in 1 damage and (6 % 4 = 1 & 2) 2 Dice Size -> D10 damage. 
Falling from 17m results in 4 damage and (17 % 4 = 4 & 1) 1 Dice Size -> D8 damage. If the result on the dice is 1 (-1 Score) the target still takes 4 damage.

### Hitting a wall
When hitting a wall with great force, subtract initial distance to a wall from the maximum distance you would travel without hitting an obstacle. For resulting value the rules as for falling apply, however the damage cannot be reduced with Agility roll.

For example standing 1 meter from a wall and being pushed into it 3 meters is equal to falling from 2 meters.
Standing 3 meters from a wall and being pushed into it 9 meters is equal to falling from 6 meters.
